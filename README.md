# HoMM_grids

Testing HoMM (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09950) in simple grid-world RL tasks.

The color-dimension to shape-dimension meta-mapping generalization experiments can be found in the `more_distant_generalization` branch (<https://github.com/lampinen/homm_grids/tree/more_distant_generalization>).
