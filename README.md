# HoMM_grids

Testing meta-mapping (<https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04318>) in simple grid-world RL tasks (with pixel inputs).

The color-dimension to shape-dimension meta-mapping generalization experiment code can be found in the `more_distant_generalization` branch (<https://github.com/lampinen/homm_grids/tree/more_distant_generalization>), but note that the analysis code for those experiments is in this branch.
